        <p>These blushing breakfast pancakes will leave you tickled pink on Shrove Tuesday with their</p> 
        <p>fun ombr√© colours. For a perfect pile, keep the pan hot, don't use too much oil and, if you can,</p>  
        <p>rest your batter for lighter, fluffier pancakes. Keen to add more flavour? Swap the milk for buttermilk or yogurt.</p>
