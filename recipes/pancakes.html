        <h1>Pancakes</h1>

            <p>These blushing breakfast pancakes will leave you tickled pink on Shrove Tuesday with their<br>
            fun ombré colours. For a perfect pile, keep the pan hot, don't use too much oil and, if you can,<br>  
            rest your batter for lighter, fluffier pancakes. Keen to add more flavour? Swap the milk for buttermilk or yogurt.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2> 
         <ul>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>200ml whole milk</li>
            <li>2 tsp sunflower oil, plus 1 tbsp extra for frying</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Greek-style yogurt</li>
            <li>175g plain flour</li>
            <li>1 tbsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp bicarbonate of soda</li>
            <li>2 tsp caster sugar</li>
            <li>15g tube Dr. Oetker extra strong pink gel food colour</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For the topping</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>150g Greek-style yogurt</li>
            <li>80g blueberries</li>
            <li>80g raspberries</li>
            <li>40g pistachios, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>4-6 tbsp maple syrup, to taste</li>
            <li>icing sugar, for dusting</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Lightly whisk the eggs, milk, 2 tsp sunflower oil and yogurt in a mixing bowl.<br> 
               Sift the flour into a separate large bowl and stir in the remaining dry ingredients.<br> 
                Make a well in the centre and pour in the milk mix; whisk to combine.</li><br>
            
            <li>Divide the mixture between 4 bowls; you should have around 120g of mix in each bowl.<br> 
                Mix 1 tsp pink colouring into the first bowl, ¼ tsp into the second and 1⁄8 tsp into the third.<br> 
                Leave the fourth bowl plain.</li><br>

            <li>Heat a frying pan over a medium- low heat and brush with oil. Working one at a time, spoon 4 tbsp batter per pancake into the pan; <br>
                it will spread to be about 10cm wide (you will get 2 pancakes from each colour). <br>
                Cook for 1 min or until bubbles appear on the surface, then flip and cook for another 1 min or until lightly browned and cooked through. <br>
                Transfer to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm while you cook the remaining pancakes.</li><br>    
            
            <li>Stack the pancakes onto a serving plate, with the darkest shade at the bottom and the plain pancakes at the top. <br>
                Top with 2-3 tbsp yogurt, 20g each blueberries and raspberries, 10g pistachios and 2 tbsp maple syrup, then dust with icing sugar. <br>
                Serve with the remaining toppings on the side.</li><br>
                
        </ol>
