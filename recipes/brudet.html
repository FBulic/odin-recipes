    <h1>Brudet</h1>
    <img src="../images/brudet.jpeg" alt="Brudet">
    <p>When I hear the word Brodet, my mouth starts to water. I absolutely love this classic Dalmatian dish, and you will too! <br>
        Brodet is a seafood stew and an essential part of Croatian coastal food culture, <br>
        just like all seafood - hello Octopus Salad and Shrimp Risotto.</p>
     
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 kg fish. We always enjoy scorpion fish, ccean perch, conger eel, reef and rockfish species the best (3lbs 5oz).<br> 
            Just take what you can get that is fresh from your fishmonger</li>

        <li>50 ml extra virgin olive oil (1/4 cup)</li>

        <li>4 tablespoons white vinegar (more if you like)</li>

        <li>Six garlic cloves, sliced</li>

        <li>½ bunch flat-leaf parsley, chopped</li>

        <li>3 large onions, finely chopped</li>

        <li>½ cup finely chopped tomatoes (more if you like)</li>

        <li>Salt & pepper</li>

        <li>600 ml water to cover fish (2 1/2 cups)</li>

        <li>12 mussels, cleaned and debearded</li>

        <li>6 scampi</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Get yourself a large heavy-based saucepan, heat the oil and fry the garlic and onion <br>
            on a low to medium heat for a couple of minutes</li><br>

        <li>Add the tomatoes and a little water and cook for around 10 minutes</li><br>

        <li>Season the fish with salt and then add it to the saucepan and mix the fish with the garlic, onion and tomatoes</li><br>

        <li>Add water so that it covers the fish</li><br>

        <li>Pour in the vinegar and pepper and simmer. You want the stew just simmering</li><br>

        <li>Allow the fish to cook for 20 minutes giving the saucepan the occasional shake.<br> 
            <strong>DO NOT stir as you will break the fish</strong></li><br>

        <li>Check the seasoning. Add more salt and pepper if required</li><br>

        <li>It's now time to put your scampi into the saucepan - throw them in one-by-one</li><br>

        <li>After five mins, check on the progress of your fish. It should be close to being done -  however, <br>
            this will vary depending on the type and size of the fish. Leave the fish for as long as it needs to be cooked through</li><br>

        <li>Approx five minutes before this fish is cooked, toss in your mussels and parsley</li><br>

        <li>Serve the brodet with creamy polenta and garnish with some parsley</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>NOTES:</strong><strong> up with crusty fresh bread a Croatian white wine to finish it off!</strong></p>
